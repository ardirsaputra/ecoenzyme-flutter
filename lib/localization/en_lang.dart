      "Ecoenzyme or garbage enzyme is a complex solution fermented from organic waste such as fruit and vegetable waste with brown sugar or molasses and water with the help of selective microorganisms from the fungi and bacteria group for 3 months. The fermented solution has a brown color old and has a strong sweet-sour smell typical of fermented products.",
  "beranda_2":
      "Ecoenzyme were developed by a researcher from Thailand, namely Dr. Rosukon Poompanvong in 2006. Ecoenzymes are said to contain protein chains (enzymes), organic acids, and mineral salts which are obtained easily from organic waste fermentation. Ecoenzymes have similarities with enzymes that have a high rate of degradation in a short time. Researchers suggest that this ecoenzyme can function for 4 categories: decompose, compose, transform, and catalysis.",
  "beranda_3":
      "To make ecoenzyme, prepare brown sugar or molasses, vegetable and fruit waste, water, and a closed container. The ratio between brown sugar or molasses, vegetable and fruit waste, and water is 1:3:10. In order to produce a solution ecoenzymes that have an aromatic smell, then the use of fruit waste can be increased.",
  "beranda_4":
      "Ecoenzyme can be used for natural household cleaning fluids, floor cleaners, detergents, natural antiseptics, preventing clogging of drains, removing unpleasant odors, treating waste water, antimicrobial agents, mosquito repellents, insecticides, pesticides, fertilizers, handling accumulation of heavy metals. The following table compares the volume of ecoenzymes and water used for various needs.",
  "beranda_5":
      "Ecoenzyme made from waste peels of apples, and eggplants can increase nutrition for the soil (expressed by the addition of nitrogen and organic matter content) with a concentration ratio of use between ecoenzymes and water is 1:800.",

  "tentang_1":
      "This application was built with Flutter by introducing modern UI and perfecting the calculation of the calculation of the eco enzyme application in the play store",
  "tentang_2":
      "This application can be made into mobile, iOS, desktop and web applications because it uses the Flutter framework",
  "tentang_3":
      "This application was created by: Ardi, Nourma, Mifta, Tiara, Euis, Tika, and Fitri.\n\nThe Application Development Training Using Flutter and Laravel was held at a computer lab, electrical engineering, Lampung University.\n \nThis training introduces Flutter as a framework for creating applications, this training makes 2 applications, namely the Note application which integrates with the Laravel api, and this eco enzyme application, and is carried out for 6 days",
